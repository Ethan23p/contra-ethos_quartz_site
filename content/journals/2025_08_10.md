- Today I'll hammer out the "about me" section.
- [[about me]] :
	- Biography bio
		- old:
			- Creative technologist uniting design, philosophy, and coding to create unconventional solutions across software, 3D animation, and games. Driven by efficiency, elegance, and a relentless pursuit of innovation.
		- new:
			- [REDACTED] (formatting errors lol)
	- personal bio
	- contact
		- personal comms
		- social media
	- creating, [[notes about my tech stack]]
		- LATER I should make a new component which is: the 'breadcrumbs', then a ' / ', and then the 'content meta'

			- Perhaps this could be the left of two columns (flex sizing), and the right could be the tags.
		- LATER In [[about me]] I want to turn my contact info into a 3 column table, centered; col1 is title, col2 is icon (not sure if tiny icons are a given in this system), col3 is the links
		  id:: 6899239c-6add-4cc6-b4ff-b62b6ed7715f
		- LATER I should retcon the code which excludes the index to instead exclude any pages with a corresponding 'tag' (not the actual tag system as that is reserved for content)
		  id:: 689925f7-50dd-49b5-99bb-c723cba55ad9
		- LATER I believe Quartz does not natively support 'block embedding' from Logseq; if so, I may very well need to create that as a transformer plugin; surely the community has already done that, right??
