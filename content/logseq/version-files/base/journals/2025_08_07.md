- Starting my public site! It will serve as my portfolio for when I'm bidding on contracts, a public front for me, a web resume, and as a way to reach out to me.
	- Naturally I have no clue how to start; so I'll just layout the site starting with:
		- [[index]]
			- [[portfolio]]
			- [[about me]]
			- [[blog]]
