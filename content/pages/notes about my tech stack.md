## for your information
	- To make this website I'm using a wonderful combination of technologies:
		- I write the entirety of site content entirely in #Logseq, which operates on a set of #Markdown files, which are read, translated into a static site using #Quartz-4, which is hosted on the internet using #Github's service, "Github Pages".

	- ### #digital-garden principles to adopt:
		- You will feel an obligation to link to / explain everything you discuss but part of the *gardening* of this concept is getting the valuable thoughts out *first* then returning later and maintaining what you write.
		- You will feel an obligation to give an LLM every other sentence you type to better comprehend grammar & spelling; yeah, that's a really good impulse. I bet you'll be doing that for just a while, then you will not even need to anymore.
